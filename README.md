# Confidence Interval Calculation
### This task demonstrates the construction of confidence intervals for a small sample dataset using both the t-distribution (when the population standard deviation is unknown) and the z-distribution (when the population standard deviation is known). The analysis includes:

## Mathematical Calculations:
- Calculation of the 99% confidence interval using the sample standard deviation (t-distribution).
- Calculation of the 99% confidence interval using the known population standard deviation (z-distribution).
